<h2>JavaScript Data Types</h2>

<p>JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
let x;         // Now x is undefined
x = 5;         // Now x is a Number
x = "John";    // Now x is a String

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
</script>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
let answer1 = "It's alright";
let answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";
let answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"';

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
answer1 + "<br>" + 
answer2 + "<br>" + 
answer3;
</script>

</body>
